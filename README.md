## Features

- Interactive Buttons: The "buttons" have an assigned letter which is attached to a sound...the user can hear the sound by pressing the specific letters on their keyboard
- Responsive Design: The app is designed to be responsive, ensuring a user-friendly experience on both desktop and mobile devices.

## How to Use

2. Press letters: A, S, D, F, G, H, J, K and/or L to hear the sounds

## Implementation Details

The Drum Kit Web App is implemented using HTML, JavaScript, and CSS for styling.

The app consists of two main functions:

- playSound: When a key is pressed the playSound(e) function is run. The correct key and audio is selected by using a querySelector
  and grabbing the specific key and audio using an assigned key-code. The sound is also rewound quickly so a user can
  click the sound in quick succession by adding .currentTime = 0 to audio. The 'playing' style is added to the letter box
  by putting a .classList.add("playing") on key.
- removeTransiition: This function looks for a propertyName that is equal to "transform" when a key is clicked...and the end of the
  transform time the "playing" styles are removed. This function is triggered when a key is pressed because an eventListener
  was attached to each individual key.

## Usage

Use your keyboard to click on the letter and hear the sounds!!
